Supervised Learning

- type of machine learning where the model is trained on a LABELED DATASET. This means training data includes both the input features (also called X) and the corresponding correct output (called y). 

- The goal is for the model to learn the mapping from inputs to outputs so it can make predictions on new, unseen data.


Key Characteristics of Supervised Learning

    - Labeled Data: you have both the inputs (features) and the correct outputs (labels) for each training example

    - Goal: model's task is to learn a function that maps inputs (features) to the correct outputs (labels)

    - Prediction: Once trained, the model can make predictions on new data where the labels are unknown.
